## ✨ Why Skybridge?

ChatGPT Apps and MCP Apps let you embed **rich, interactive UIs** directly in AI conversations. But the raw SDKs are low-level—no hooks, no type safety, no dev tools, and no HMR.

**Skybridge fixes that.**

| | |
|:--|:--|
| 🌐 **Write once, run everywhere** — Skybridge works seamlessly with ChatGPT (Apps SDK) and MCP-compatible clients. | ✅ **End-to-End Type Safety** — tRPC-style inference from server to view. Autocomplete everywhere. |
| 🔄 **View-to-Model Sync** — Keep the model aware of UI state with `data-llm`. Dual surfaces, one source of truth. | ⚒️ **React Query-style Hooks** — `isPending`, `isError`, callbacks. State management you already know. |
| 👨‍💻 **Full dev environment** — HMR, debug traces, and local devtools. | 📦 **Showcase Examples** — Production-ready examples to learn from and build upon. |

<br />

## 🚀 Get Started

```bash
npm create skybridge@latest
```

## 📦 Architecture

Skybridge is a fullstack framework with unified server and client modules:

- **`skybridge/server`** — Define tools and views with full type inference. Extends the MCP SDK.
- **`skybridge/web`** — React hooks that consume your server types. Works with Apps SDK (ChatGPT) and MCP Apps.
- **Dev Environment** — Vite plugin with HMR, DevTools emulator, and optimized builds.

### Server

```ts
import { McpServer } from "skybridge/server";

server.registerView("flights", {}, {
  inputSchema: { destination: z.string() },
}, async ({ destination }) => {
  const flights = await searchFlights(destination);
  return { structuredContent: { flights } };
});
```

### View

```tsx
import { useToolInfo } from "skybridge/web";

function FlightsView() {
  const { output } = useToolInfo();

  return output.structuredContent.flights.map(flight =>
    <FlightCard key={flight.id} flight={flight} />
  );
}
```

<br />

## 🎯 Features at a Glance

- **Live Reload** — Vite HMR. See changes instantly without reinstalling.
- **Typed Hooks** — Full autocomplete for tools, inputs, outputs.
- **View → Tool Calls** — Trigger server actions from UI.
- **Dual Surface Sync** — Keep model aware of what users see with `data-llm`.
- **React Query-style API** — `isPending`, `isError`, callbacks.
- **Platform Agnostic** — Works with ChatGPT (Apps SDK) and MCP Apps clients (Goose, VSCode, etc.).
- **MCP Compatible** — Extends the official SDK. Works with any MCP client.
